# Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language.

This repository contains practical intro usage of Python:
- API [here](/APIs/)
- Collections [here](/Collections/)
- Control flow [here](/Control%20flow/)
- File handling [here](/File%20handling/)
- Libraries [here](/Libraries/)
- OOP [here](/OOP/)
- Unit test [here](/Unittest/)

<!-- ## Collections
Python’s general purpose built-in collection types:
- dict
    - key-value pair
    - values are called by specifying the key
    - insertion ordered (3.6+)
    - Example: `{x: 3, y: 4, z: 4}`
- list
    - mutable ordered sequences of items
    - indexed (position of the element)
    - elements are called by specifying index
    - ordered
    - Example: `[3, 4, 4]`
- set
    - no duplicate elements
    - unordered
    - Example: `{3, 4}`
- tuple
    - immutable ordered sequences of items
    - Example: `(3, 4, 4)`


## Control Flow
- Control flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated
- The control flow of a Python program is regulated by conditional statements, loops, and function calls

## Python libraries
- A collection of codes or modules of codes that we can use in a program for specific operations
- We don’t need to write the code again in our program that is already available
- We use libraries by importing them -->
